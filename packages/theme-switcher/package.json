Ideal for themes like Solarized that provide both light and dark versions that you may want to switch to under different lighting conditions.\n\nMapped to F12 by default.\n\nSee also [outdoor-theme](https://github.com/mattapperson/outdoor-theme), which didn't work for me at time of writing but is theoretically automatic and thus much cooler.\n",
