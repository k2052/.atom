# Atom Theme Switcher

Switches between one theme and another when you hit a key. Ideal for themes like Solarized that provide both light and dark versions that you may want to switch to under different lighting conditions.

Mapped to F12 by default.

See also [outdoor-theme](https://github.com/mattapperson/outdoor-theme), which didn't work for me at time of writing but is theoretically automatic and thus much cooler.
